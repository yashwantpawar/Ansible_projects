:'
The given playbook attempts to add an entry into the /etc/resolv.conf file for nameserver.
First, we run a command using the shell module to get the contents of /etc/resolv.conf file and then
we add a new line containing the name server data into the file.
However, when this playbook is run multiple times, it keeps adding new entries of same line into
the resolv.conf file.
Add a register directive to store the output of the first command to variable command_output
Then add a conditional to the second command to check if the output contains the name server (10.0.250.10) already.
Use command_output.stdout.find(<IP>) == -1
#Note: A better way to do this would be to use the lineinfile module. This is just for practice.
#Note: shell and command modules are similar in that they are used to execute a command on the system. However shell executes the command inside a shell giving us access to environment variables and redirection using >>
